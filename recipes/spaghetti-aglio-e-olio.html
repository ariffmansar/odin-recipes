        No two aglio e olio recipes are alike, but this one is pretty true to the classic method. The key is slowly
        toasting the garlic slices to a perfect golden brown in the olive oil. If it's too light, you don't get the full
        flavor and if it's too dark it gets bitter. My advice? Do it perfectly.

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>1 pount uncooked spaghetti</li>
        <li>½ cup olive oil</li>
