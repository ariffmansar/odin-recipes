About:
This project is to put the things that I have learned into practice. I will be making a recipe website that includes elements like, lists, images and links.

Entry after completion:
Succesful project. Easy and straightforward. You now know how to make a basic recipe website that includes boilerplates, links (absolute and relative), images and height/width adjustment with pixels and %'s, ordered and unordered lists, paragraphs, and headings. Even though css hasn't been used, you still know very basic css code. We will make another project later that properly involves css.
